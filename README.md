# Farm

Farm is a single channel installation that utilises a Kodak carousel slide projector to display a series of 80 images consecutively. The images that are projected originate from an archive made available by Twitter in 2018. This archive was part of a larger dataset released by the microblogging company as part of their investigation into ‘foreign interference in political conversations’ on the social media platform in the the wake of the US presidential election. The database features over 3,000 twitter accounts, the majority of which originated in Russia and contains over 10 million Tweets and more than 2 million images, GIFs and videos dating back to 2009.
